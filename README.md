## Description

_This project is the landing page for my programming portfolio. It covers a lot of information about myself and my experience thus far at epicodus. I created a webpage that encompassed all the skills and ideas I have learned in my first four days at Epicodus. I also included previous projects I have worked on here in the Epicodus classroom in my portfolio webpage, to further highlight what we have covered thus far._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _I created a new directory labled portfolio-webpage_
* _In that directory I created a css folder, index.html, and placed bootstrap.css & styles.css within the css directory_
* _At this point I started to create the bare bones of my webpage by putting in the HTML_
* _Then I went in and styled it using styles.css and bootstrap.css_
* _Lastly I was always going back seeing where I could improve, and fix index.html and styles.css_


## Known Bugs

_I couldn't quite get my image to load when I pushed my branch gh-pages-portfolio to GH-Pages_
